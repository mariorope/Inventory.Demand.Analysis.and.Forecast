# Inventory.Demand.Analysis.and.Forecast
This project was developed as part of my studies at the course Big Data Analytics with R and Azure ML offerec by Data Science Academy. It was developed a predictive model to support the inventory demand forecast, based on the XGBoost algorithm.

The data set was very large to be attached to this respository, but it can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand.
